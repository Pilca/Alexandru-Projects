Task is to write Oracle script which will execute following sub-tasks:
 
1. Create a table CARS with following columns and these data types:
 
Brand                    VARCHAR2
Model                    VARCHAR2
Date_of_manufacturing    DATE
Color                    VARCHAR2
Number_of_doors          NUMBER
 
(Besides these, table needs to also contain primary key column. Number_of_doors column is not mandatory, all of the other columns are mandatory).
 
2. Insert 3 rows in the table with some dummy data. Date_of_manufacturing column should contain the entire date with some valid day and month (Can use AI to generate the data).
 
3. Write PL/SQL function which will be used to update specific car in the table. These are requirements:
Function's signature should containe these arguments:
 
P_ID,
P_MODEL,
P_DATE_OF_MANUF.
 
Function should return NUMBER data type.
 
Data types of all arguments needs to be the same as data types in the table (use ROWTYPE attribute when specifying signature).
Function should update the table with the values passed in.
It should return the YEAR compoment of the new Date_of_manufacturing in number format.
 
After declaring this function, call it with specific values and row needs to be updated with these new values.
 
At the end script should output the new year with dbms_output. This call should not be inside the function.
 
Create a new repository on you Github account and put the script file there.
